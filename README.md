This file serves as top-level documentation for the paper artefacts (including experimental raw data, processing scripts, and final figures). Additional documentation is available in the individual directories whenever relevant.

A list of files is included at the end of this README, with a short description for each.

**Note** The test results in this directory only contain the serial dump files (which are sufficient for the data processing realized for the upper-mentioned paper). The complete Flocklab test results (including GPIO traces) are available [upon request](mailto:jacobr@ethz.ch).

## Data Processing Tool Chain

The processing should in principal work on any computer capable on running Matlab and Python.

**Tested configurations**
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Matlab R2018b, Python 2.7.12

The Matlab files should be compatible with Windows setups as well (no guarantees, un-tested).


### Duty-cycle and Packet Reception Ratio
The `serial_logs_processing.m` Matlab script contains fetches experiment raw data and computes and outputs the DC and PRR metrics for the different protocols. 
- Select the desired `result_to_parse`.
- Adjust the `tests` and `experiments`.
- Run the script. The output is displayed in the Matlab Command Window.

### Lines of Code

Run the `lineofcode.py` script. Instructions are provided therein.

### Binary size

Requires the GCC-msp430 toolchain. On a linux system, it can be installed  with the command
```
sudo apt install gcc-msp430
```

Run the msp430-size utility on the binary files `.sky` and `.dpp-cc430` respectively (provided in the respective protocol directories).
